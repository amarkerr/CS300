**•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In this course, we delved into the diverse methodologies of data storage, gaining proficiency in the relevant algorithms essential for coding these storage systems. Our prefinal assignment involved an in-depth analysis of three distinct data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary trees. This task entailed the development of pseudocode for each storage type, alongside a comparative study of their efficacy in a small-scale project. For our culminating project, we were tasked with creating a sophisticated program capable of processing a dataset containing course IDs, titles, and prerequisites. This program was designed not only to store this data efficiently but also to enable two key functionalities: generating a complete, alphanumeric-ordered list of courses, and conducting targeted searches for specific courses using their IDs.


**•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

In tackling this challenge, I adopted a strategic approach centered on identifying the key functionalities essential to the client or the project at hand. For this endeavor, the project requirements specified sorting data in alphanumeric order and enabling searchable outputs. However, extrapolating to a real-world scenario, it became apparent that a potential client would value the flexibility to seamlessly update and modify course information, given the dynamic nature of course rosters. Among the three data structures we explored in this course, the binary tree emerged as the optimal choice, adeptly accommodating all these needs. A deep comprehension of various data structures is crucial in such decision-making processes. Recognizing that no single data structure is universally optimal, the ability to discern the strengths and limitations of each enables us to select the most suitable tool for each unique project.


**•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

My journey through this course was marked by significant challenges, particularly in the initial stages where I grappled with the implementation of hash tables and binary trees for early assignments. Being new to these concepts, I immersed myself in extensive research to bridge my knowledge gap. My go-to strategy in such situations involves leveraging resources like Stack Overflow, various online forums, and even instructional videos on YouTube. I prioritize resources that offer clear explanations and practical examples, which I then meticulously integrate into my work, accompanied by rigorous testing. This experience also marked my first deep dive into the more intricate uses of pointers, a venture that, while challenging, proved to be exceptionally rewarding and enjoyable.


**•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

While this course has not fundamentally altered my approach to development, it has significantly expanded my toolkit. This enhancement now empowers me to craft more sophisticated and complex programs, broadening the scope of my capabilities in software development.


**•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

This project has been instrumental in advancing my skills with hash tables and binary trees, significantly boosting my ability to craft adaptable code. Each project I undertake serves as a valuable learning experience, continually refining my approach to maintainability and readability. In this specific endeavor, I emphasized the importance of thorough commenting. This was crucial not only for future readers to understand the capabilities of the data structures but also as a reference for myself. Furthermore, I gained the insight that these data storage methods are akin to design patterns, offering reusable solutions for various projects. This realization has markedly improved the efficiency of my work, allowing me to develop more sophisticated and effective software solutions.
